 Project Overview
PowerPulse is a machine learning project aimed at forecasting household energy consumption using historical power usage data. The model helps in energy management by providing predictive insights that can be leveraged by both consumers and energy providers for better planning, efficiency, and sustainability.

🎯 Problem Statement
In today's energy-conscious world, efficient energy management is crucial. By predicting energy usage accurately:

Households can reduce bills and form energy-efficient habits.

Energy Providers can plan resource distribution and pricing more effectively.

The objective is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts global active power consumption and provides actionable insights into household energy usage patterns.

💼 Business Use Cases
Household Energy Management: Monitor and reduce electricity usage.

Demand Forecasting: Improve supply chain planning for energy companies.

Anomaly Detection: Identify irregular or unauthorized usage.

Smart Grid Optimization: Enable real-time predictive analytics.

Environmental Impact: Reduce energy wastage and carbon footprint.

🔧 Approach
1. Data Understanding and Exploration
Loaded and explored dataset structure and quality.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and anomalies.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing/inconsistent values.

Parsed timestamps and extracted relevant features (e.g., hour, day).

Created derived features like daily averages, rolling means, and peak hours.

Scaled features for optimal model performance.

3. Feature Engineering
Selected influential features for predicting energy usage.

Considered possible integration of external data (e.g., weather conditions).

4. Model Training and Tuning
Split dataset into train/test sets.

Trained multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks (MLPRegressor)

Applied hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization.

5. Model Evaluation
Used metrics for model comparison:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² (R-squared)

Analyzed feature importance and model interpretability.

📈 Results
Developed an accurate forecasting model for household power consumption.

Gained insights into key drivers of energy usage.

Produced effective visualizations to represent trends and model performance.
